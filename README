=On errors=
If you ever get an error that isn't a formal logging error (ERROR     | [error message]), let me know and I'll add in coverage for it.


=Required file structure=

-scan_dir/
|-faction/          [slurm output and errors will go here]
|-modfiles/         [modfiles stored here]
|-obsfiles/         [obsfiles stored here]
|-logfiles/         [logfiles will be written here from launch_fitting.sbatch]
|-waction/          [temporary files for write actions saved here]
||-logs/            [logs of write_fit calling mpar and wpar are saved here]
|-par/              [location of par files, named wpar, mpar, fpar etc]
|-namecores.txt     [names of all files (saved in mod/obsfiles) launch_fitting should run]


==Python scripts==
change_obs_weights.py
 - Changes the weights of specified (by type and number) data sets to given value
freeze_mod.py
 - Changes the freeze state of specified components/parameters to given value
grid_scan.py
 - Runs a 2-D grid scan of specified parameters
line_scan.py
 - Runs a 1-D grid scan of specified parameter
write_fit.py
 - Creates a pdf with the orthogonal views of a model and its fits to all relevant data types

==Bash scripts==
launch_fitting.sbatch
 - Runs slurm array job for every mod/obs combo specified in namecores.txt
 - If given positional argument (for angle2) will assume its a polescan and run fits in ./subscans/[angle2]. (Will assume directories exist. These are created by grid_scan)
bash_scripts/create_pdf.sh
 - Used by write_fit.py, no need to run by itself
bash_scripts/tri2mod.sh
 - WIP, might not work in certain scenarios. Goes through the process of turning a convex inversion trimod file to a shape mod file
bash_scripts/ConvInvSol_mkvertmod.sh
 - Needs updating and renaming but it works
 - Run in directory, will apply either mkvertmod or mkhardmod with specified parameters to all files in ./modfiles/

==Notebooks==
Combine_polescans.ipynb
 - For use after a grid_scan --angle2-range. Will combine all grid scans in ./subscans/*, taking the best value for each pole solution and saving to specified directory
 - Can also be used for combinging low/high res scans etc
Gen_Linescan.opynb
 - Plots the result of a line scan
Gen_Polescan.ipynb
 - Plots the result of a grid_scan (for polescans, but should work, with quirks, for other grid scans)
Rank_Polescan.ipynb
 - For when you are down to a few models, will rank all of the logfiles by the reduced chisquared values.
